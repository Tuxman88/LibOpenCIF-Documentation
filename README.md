LibOpenCIF-Documentation
========================

This  package  contains the main documentation of LibOpenCIF. In this case, the
main  document  is the complete User and Technical manual for LibOpenCIF in PDF
format.  Also, in this package the user can find other useful resources for the
developer that expects to use this library:

* Main documentation (User and Technical Maual in PDF form) that also contains the full support table defined for the library.
* The official CIF v2 manual that contains the official specifications for the format, in PDF.
* A complete diagram for the Finite State Machine used in LibOpenCIF for validation of the input files.
* A complete diagram for the classes contained in the library, alongside their relationships.
* A useful TXT file containing the Support Table in ASCII form.
* The examples of the library.
* The complete source files for the documentation itself (TEX and images for the manual, and DIA files for the diagrams).

Because of the size of the manual (due to the resources included), the document
would be included in this standalone package.
